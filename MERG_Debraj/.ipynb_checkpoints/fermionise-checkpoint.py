OVERVIEW
This is a library for wavefunction renormalisation calculations with the URG.
The strategy adopted is as follows:
1. Perform the forward Hamiltonian RG to get the set of couplings along the RG flow.
2. Using the couplings at the IR fixed point, write down a zero-bandwidth Hamiltonian.
3. Diagonalise this Hamiltonian to get the IR ground state.
4. Express this ground state as a superposition of classical states. For eg:, 
   |up,dn> - |dn,up> = |10> - |01>, where {|10>,|01>} are the classical states and 
   {1,-1} are the coefficients.
5. Apply the inverse RG transformations on these classical states to generate a new 
   set of coefficients for each RG step going backwards.
6. These sets of coefficients constitute the wavefunction RG flow. Use these to 
   calculate various measures along the RG flow.

ASSUMPTIONS & CONVENTIONS
1. Fermionic impurity model Hamiltonian.
2. All operators must be composed of c^dag, c, n or 1-n, where each operator acts on a 
   single fermionic fock state.
3. The indexing of sites is as follows:
        d_up    d_dn    k1_up   k1_dn   k2_up   k2_dn   ...
        0       1       2       3       4       5       ...,
   where up,dn indicates spins and k1,k2 need not be momentum space but can be real
   space indices. That will be decided based on whether the provided Hamiltonian is
   in real or k-space.

Forn=2S=5 the model describes manganese impurities dissolved in a metal. It is shown that atn>2S the effective exchange coupling approaches a finite fixed point as the energy scale decreases. It means that atn>2S the Gell-Mann-Low function turns to zero in this point and the scaling behaviour of physical quantities is observed. The scaling behaviour, first obtained in the 1D quantum field theory, can be analyzed on the basis of the exact solution. In the casen≦2S the effective coupling becomes infinitely strong at low energies.},

At ⩽2S the effective charge increases to infinity at low energies, whereas atn > 2S it tends to a finite fixed point.

We survey the properties of the model, how a magnetic two-channel Kondo effect might obtain for ions in metals, and a quadrupolar Kondo effect for ions in metals. We suggest that the incoherent metal behaviour of the two-channel Kondo-lattice model may be useful in understanding the unusual normal-state resistivity of and speculate that the residual resistivity and entropy of the two-channel lattice paramagnetic phase might be removed by either antiferromagnetic (or antiferroquadrupolar) ordering or by a superconducting transition to an odd-frequency pairing state.}

abstract={When a magnetic impurity exists in a metal, conduction electrons form a spin cloud that screens the impurity spin. This basic phenomenon is called the Kondo effect1,2. Unlike electric-charge screening, the spin-screening cloud3--6 occurs quantum coherently, forming spin-singlet entanglement with the impurity. Although the spins interact locally around the impurity, the Kondo cloud can theoretically spread out over several micrometres. The cloud has not so far been detected, and so its physical existence---a fundamental aspect of the Kondo effect---remains controversial7,8. Here we present experimental evidence of a Kondo cloud extending over a length of micrometres, comparable to the theoretical length $\xi$K. In our device, a Kondo impurity is formed in a quantum dot2,9--11, coupling on one side to a quasi-one-dimensional channel12 that houses a Fabry--P{\'e}rot interferometer of various gate-defined lengths L exceeding one micrometre. When we sweep a voltage on the interferometer end gate---separated by L from the quantum dot---to induce Fabry--P{\'e}rot oscillations in conductance we observe oscillations in the measured Kondo temperature TK, which is a signature of the Kondo cloud at distance L. When L is less than $\xi$K the TK oscillation amplitude becomes larger as L becomes smaller, obeying a scaling function of a single parameter L/$\xi$K, whereas when L is greater than $\xi$K the oscillation is much weaker. Our results reveal that $\xi$K is the only length parameter associated with the Kondo effect, and that the cloud lies mostly within a length of $\xi$K. Our experimental method offers a way of detecting the spatial distribution of exotic non-Fermi liquids formed by multiple magnetic impurities or multiple screening channels13--16 and of studying spin-correlated systems.},

abstract={Metallic, oxygen-deficient compounds in the Ba−La−Cu−O system, with the composition BaxLa5−xCu5O5(3−y) have been prepared in polycrystalline form. Samples withx=1 and 0.75,y>0, annealed below 900{\textdegree}C under reducing conditions, consist of three phases, one of them a perovskite-like mixed-valent copper compound. Upon cooling, the samples show a linear decrease in resistivity, then an approximately logarithmic increase, interpreted as a beginning of localization. Finally an abrupt decrease by up to three orders of magnitude occurs, reminiscent of the onset of percolative superconductivity. The highest onset temperature is observed in the 30 K range. It is markedly reduced by high current densities. Thus, it results partially from the percolative nature, bute possibly also from 2D superconducting fluctuations of double perovskite layers of one of the phases present.},
